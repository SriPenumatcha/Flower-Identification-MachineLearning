## Overview

**Purpose:** The aim of this project is to prepare a data deep dive to show machine learning in the automated identification of flower species based on identifying features in a dataset.

**Data Collection:** Weâ€™ve gathered a dataset of flower images, including various species, each labeled with the correct flower name from Kaggle.

**Model Training:** Using CNNs, we have trained our model on this dataset to learn features that distinguish different flowers.

**Prediction:** When users upload flower images, our model will predict the flower type based on the learned patterns.

## Results

**Accuracy:** Model 4 with InceptionV3 transfer learning achieved the highest accuracy of 84.25%

**Data Processing:** Model 4 utilized transfer learning for improved performance

**Model Complexity:** Model 2 had the most advanced architecture with Batch Normalization and data augmentation.

**Training Duration:** Model 2 had the longest training duration with 100 epochs.

In conclusion, Model 4 utilizing transfer learning with InceptionV3 outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy. Model 2 showed significant improvement with advanced techniques, while Model 3 had a simpler architecture but achieved moderate accuracy. Model 1, the basic CNN model, had the lowest accuracy among the four models.

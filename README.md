## Overview

**Purpose:** The aim of this project is to prepare a data deep dive to show machine learning in the automated identification of flower species based on identifying features in a dataset.

**Data Collection:** Weâ€™ve gathered a dataset of flower images, including various species, each labeled with the correct flower name from Kaggle.

**Model Training:** Using CNNs, we have trained our model on this dataset to learn features that distinguish different flowers.

**Prediction:** When users upload flower images, our model will predict the flower type based on the learned patterns.

## Requirements

Your assignment will be graded according to the expectations outlined below:

**Data Model Implementation (25 points)**
    
* A Python script initialises, trains, and evaluates a model (10 points)

* The data is cleaned, normalised, and standardised prior to modelling (5 points)

* The model utilises data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)

* The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)

**Data Model Optimisation (25 points)**

* The model optimisation and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself (15 points)

* Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script (10 points)

**GitHub Documentation (25 points)**

* GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use (10 points)

* The README is customised as a polished presentation of the content of the project (15 points)
